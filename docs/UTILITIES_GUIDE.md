## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Before Starting Work:**
   - Run `claude-check` for health status
   - Run `claude-mcp` if using Azure/GitHub

   - Use specialized agents proactively
   - MultiEdit for same-file changes

3. **After Sessions:**
   - Run `claude-perf` for metrics
   - Review anti-patterns
   - Update workflow templates
