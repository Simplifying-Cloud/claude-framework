# Claude Framework Configuration - Balanced Performance Edition

## üéØ Intelligent Efficiency Philosophy

**CORE PRINCIPLE: OPTIMIZE INTELLIGENTLY, EXECUTE SAFELY**

Achieve exceptional performance through smart parallelization, strategic caching, and robust error handling. Balance speed with reliability to ensure sustainable, production-ready operations.

**Balanced Performance Targets:**
- ‚ö° 5-10 parallel operations per message (context-adaptive)
- üéØ 60-80% parallelization rate (dependency-aware)
- üõ°Ô∏è 100% security validation for sensitive operations
- üìä 2-3x measurable performance improvement
- üîÑ Adaptive concurrency based on system resources

## üöÄ Intelligent Parallel Execution Strategy

### Smart Parallelization Guidelines
**Parallelize when safe, serialize when necessary:**

#### 1. **File Operations - Dependency-Aware**
```markdown
‚úÖ SAFE to parallelize:
- Reading independent files (up to 10 simultaneously)
- Searching different directories
- Reading configuration files
- Analyzing separate codebases

‚ö†Ô∏è SERIALIZE when:
- Writing to the same file
- Modifying git repository state
- Creating dependent directory structures
- Handling credentials or secrets
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use MultiEdit for multiple changes to the same file
- Implement file locking for concurrent writes
- Validate permissions before batch operations
- Check file dependencies before parallel reads

#### 2. **Information Gathering - Rate-Limited**
```markdown
‚úÖ BATCH these operations:
- Independent API queries (max 5-8)
- File discovery operations
- Non-dependent searches
- Read-only operations

‚ö†Ô∏è RESPECT limits for:
- GitHub API: 50 requests per 10 minutes
- Azure ARM: 12000 reads/hour
- MCP servers: Based on configuration
- File system: Based on available handles
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Safe parallel git operations
git status & 
git branch -a &
wait  # Wait for completion before dependent operations
git diff  # Run after status completes
```

#### 3. **Agent Operations - Coordinated**
```markdown
‚úÖ Parallel agent deployment:
- Independent analysis agents (2-3 max)
- Different domain specialists
- Non-conflicting operations

‚ö†Ô∏è Sequential agent usage:
- Agents modifying same resources
- Dependent analysis chains
- Security-sensitive operations
```

#### 4. **Cloud Operations - Throttled**
```markdown
‚úÖ Safe batching:
- Read operations across services (max 10)
- Independent resource queries
- Different subscription/region queries

‚ö†Ô∏è Throttle these:
- Resource creation/modification
- Terraform operations (always sequential)
- Cross-service dependencies
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security-First Operations

### Mandatory Security Controls

#### 1. **Pre-Execution Validation**
```yaml
security_checks:
  before_parallel_ops: true
  credential_scanning: true
  permission_validation: true
  dependency_analysis: true
```

#### 2. **Sensitive Operation Handling**
- **Always serialize**: Credential operations, key management
- **Encrypt before caching**: Tokens, secrets, sensitive data
- **Validate permissions**: Before file/API access
- **Audit log**: All security-relevant operations

#### 3. **Rate Limiting Compliance**
```yaml
rate_limits:
  github_api: 50 per 600s
  azure_arm_read: 12000 per 3600s
  azure_arm_write: 1200 per 3600s
  file_operations: 100 concurrent
  default_batch: 10 operations
```

## üìä Realistic Performance Metrics

### Sustainable Targets
| Metric | Target | Maximum | Safety Threshold |
|--------|--------|---------|------------------|
| Parallel Operations | 5-8 | 10 | 12 (circuit break) |
| Parallelization Rate | 60-70% | 80% | 85% (throttle) |
| Response Time | <2s | <5s | >10s (timeout) |
| CPU Usage | 50-60% | 70% | 80% (scale down) |
| Memory Usage | 40-50% | 60% | 75% (gc trigger) |
| Error Rate | <2% | <5% | >10% (safe mode) |

## üîÑ Adaptive Execution Strategies

### Context-Aware Scaling

#### 1. **Resource-Based Adaptation**
```python
def determine_parallelism():
    cpu_available = get_cpu_availability()
    memory_available = get_memory_availability()
    
    if cpu_available > 70 and memory_available > 60:
        return 8  # High parallelism
    elif cpu_available > 50 and memory_available > 40:
        return 5  # Medium parallelism
    else:
        return 3  # Conservative parallelism
```

#### 2. **Operation-Type Scaling**
```yaml
operation_limits:
  file_reads: 10
  file_writes: 3
  api_calls: 5
  agent_spawns: 3
  git_operations: 1  # Always sequential
  security_operations: 1  # Always sequential
```

#### 3. **Failure-Based Throttling**
```yaml
throttling_rules:
  - error_rate > 10%: reduce_parallelism(50%)
  - error_rate > 5%: reduce_parallelism(25%)
  - timeout_count > 3: enable_circuit_breaker()
  - rate_limit_hit: pause_operations(60s)
```

## üö® Error Handling & Recovery

### Robust Failure Management

#### 1. **Partial Failure Recovery**
```python
async def execute_parallel_with_recovery(operations):
    results = await execute_parallel(operations)
    failed = [op for op in results if op.failed]
    
    if failed and len(failed) < len(operations) * 0.3:
        # Retry failed operations sequentially
        for op in failed:
            await retry_with_backoff(op)
    elif failed:
        # Too many failures, fall back to sequential
        return await execute_sequential(operations)
```

#### 2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
```yaml
circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 5
  timeout: 30s
  half_open_requests: 3
  reset_timeout: 60s
```

#### 3. **Rollback Mechanisms**
- Transaction boundaries for related operations
- Checkpoint creation before bulk operations
- Atomic operations for critical changes
- Version control integration for code changes

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

#### 1. **Operation Metrics**
```yaml
monitoring:
  track:
    - operation_count
    - parallelization_rate
    - success_rate
    - average_response_time
    - error_types
  alert_on:
    - error_rate > 5%
    - response_time > 5s
    - cpu_usage > 80%
    - memory_usage > 75%
```

#### 2. **Health Checks**
```bash
# Continuous health monitoring
health_check() {
    check_cpu_usage
    check_memory_usage
    check_api_limits
    check_error_rates
    check_response_times
}
```

## üéÆ Execution Modes

### 1. **Safe Mode** (Production/Critical Operations)
```yaml
safe_mode:
  max_parallel: 3
  require_validation: true
  security_checks: strict
  error_tolerance: 0.01
  rollback_enabled: true
```

### 2. **Balanced Mode** (Default)
```yaml
balanced_mode:
  max_parallel: 5-8
  adaptive_scaling: true
  security_checks: standard
  error_tolerance: 0.05
  retry_enabled: true
```

### 3. **Performance Mode** (Development/Testing)
```yaml
performance_mode:
  max_parallel: 10
  speculative_execution: true
  security_checks: basic
  error_tolerance: 0.10
  monitoring_verbose: true
```
