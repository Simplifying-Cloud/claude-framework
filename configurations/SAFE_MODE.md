# Safe Mode Configuration

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFE MODE
**Production-ready configuration prioritizing reliability and security**

### When to Use This Mode
- Production environments
- Critical operations
- Financial or healthcare systems
- Customer-facing services  
- Compliance-required operations
- When data integrity is paramount

### Core Principle
**SAFETY FIRST - RELIABILITY OVER SPEED**

### Execution Parameters
```yaml
mode: safe
parallel_operations: 3-5
maximum_tool_calls: 8
parallelization_rate: 40-60%
safety_checks: strict
error_tolerance: zero
rollback: automatic
```

### Safe Execution Rules

#### File Operations
- Read max 5 files simultaneously
- Full dependency validation before operations
- File locking for all writes
- Transaction boundaries for related changes
- Verify permissions before access

#### Information Gathering
- Sequential git operations (no parallel)
- Max 3 concurrent API calls
- Strict rate limit compliance
- Query validation before execution
- Full audit logging

#### Agent Operations
- Single agent execution at a time
- Full validation before delegation
- Security clearance for sensitive ops
- Complete logging of agent actions

#### Cloud Operations
- Sequential resource modifications
- Read operations max 5 concurrent
- Full compliance checking
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Cost validation before creation

### Safety Requirements
- Pre-execution dependency analysis
- Security validation for all operations
- Encrypted caching only
- Full audit trail
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

### Safe Patterns

```python
# SAFE: Validated execution
operations = discover_operations()
dependencies = analyze_dependencies(operations)
validated = validate_security(operations)

for batch in create_safe_batches(validated, size=3):
    try:
        results = execute_with_rollback(batch)
        verify_results(results)
    except Exception as e:
        rollback(batch)
        log_error(e)
        raise
```

```bash
# SAFE: Sequential git with validation
git status
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    git add .
    git commit -m "Safe commit"
    git push
fi
```

### Mandatory Checks
```yaml
mandatory_checks:
  dependency_validation: true
  security_scanning: true
  rate_limit_check: true
  resource_availability: true
  rollback_plan: true
  audit_logging: true
```

### Error Handling
- Immediate halt on first error
- Automatic rollback
- Full error context logging
- Alert on failures
- Manual review required for retry

### Performance Expectations
- 1.5-2x speed improvement (sustainable)
- 99.9% reliability target
- Zero data corruption tolerance
- 100% audit coverage
- Full traceability
